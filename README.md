# Anomaly-Aware 3D Segmentation of Knee Magnetic Resonance Images

This repository contains the manual segmentations and the cross-validation data splits used in "Automated anomaly-aware 3D segmentation of bones and cartilages in knee MR images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative" [1]. Note that this work also used the *OAI ZIB* dataset from <https://pubdata.zib.de/>.
